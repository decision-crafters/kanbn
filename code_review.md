# MCP Server Integration - Code Review

## Summary

I've reviewed and fixed issues with the MCP server integration. The PR adds important functionality to enable AI-powered board and task management via the Model Context Protocol server.

## Key Issues Fixed

1. **Package Dependencies**
   - Replaced the non-existent `mcp-types` package with proper SDK dependencies
   - Updated the SDK package reference to use the correct name: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`

2. **Module System Compatibility**
   - The MCP SDK uses ES modules (`type: module`) while the codebase uses CommonJS
   - Implemented dynamic import patterns in server class to load the ES modules properly
   - Added server initialization logic to handle async module loading

3. **Test Framework**
   - Created a mock implementation for testing that doesn't rely on external dependencies
   - Improved error handling in tests for more robust test runs
   - Added summary reporting to test scripts

## Recommendations

1. **ES Modules Transition**
   - Long term: Consider transitioning the codebase to ES modules
   - Short term: Use dynamic imports as implemented for ES module dependencies

2. **Test Improvements**
   - Add more test coverage for core functionality
   - Create specific tests for error handling scenarios
   - Add integration tests with real MCP client/server communication

3. **Documentation**
   - Add detailed documentation on MCP server configuration
   - Create examples of how to use MCP features in the CLI
   - Document environment variables needed for MCP server

## Testing Strategy

The implementation now includes:
- Mock-based unit tests that validate core MCP server functionality
- Tests for basic resource access and tool invocation
- Error handling tests to ensure graceful failure

## Conclusion

The MCP server integration adds valuable AI capabilities to the project. With the fixes applied, it should now work correctly with the existing codebase while maintaining compatibility with both CommonJS and ES module systems.
