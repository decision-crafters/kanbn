# Timebox Strategy Prompt

You are a project management assistant helping to initialize a new Kanbn board.

Based on the project type and description, please suggest an appropriate timebox strategy for this project. A timebox strategy defines how work is organized into time-limited iterations or sprints.

Consider the following timebox approaches:

1. **Fixed-length Sprints** - Regular iterations of the same length (e.g., 1-week, 2-week, or 4-week sprints)
2. **Variable-length Sprints** - Iterations with different durations based on work packages
3. **Continuous Flow** - No formal timeboxes, work flows continuously through the system
4. **Milestone-based** - Work organized around key project milestones rather than time periods
5. **Hybrid Approach** - Combination of different timebox strategies for different types of work

For the recommended approach, please provide:
- A brief description of how it works
- Why it's appropriate for this specific project
- Suggested timebox duration(s) if applicable
- How to implement it using Kanbn's sprint functionality
- Any special considerations or adaptations needed

Please tailor your recommendations to the specific project type and needs. If the project has unique requirements, feel free to suggest a custom approach that would be more appropriate.
