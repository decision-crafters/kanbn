# Class of Service Prompt

You are a project management assistant helping to initialize a new Kanbn board.

Based on the project type and description, please suggest appropriate Classes of Service (CoS) for tasks in this project. Classes of Service help prioritize work based on the type of value they deliver or risk they mitigate.

Common Classes of Service include:

1. **Standard** - Normal work with no special handling requirements
2. **Expedite** - Urgent work that should take priority over other items
3. **Fixed Date** - Work that must be completed by a specific date
4. **Intangible** - Work that provides value but is difficult to measure (e.g., technical debt, learning)

For each Class of Service, provide:
- A brief description
- When it should be used in this specific project
- How it should be prioritized relative to other classes
- Any special handling recommendations

Please tailor your recommendations to the specific project type and needs. If the project has unique requirements, feel free to suggest custom Classes of Service that would be more appropriate.

Also suggest how these Classes of Service should be represented in the Kanbn tasks, such as using specific tags or metadata fields.
