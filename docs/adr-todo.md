## System Architecture Overview (from linked ADRs)
The Kanbn project follows a layered architecture with separate layers for the CLI, application services, domain logic, and infrastructure. The domain model is organized around core concepts like Task, Board, and Sprint, following Domain-Driven Design principles. The system exposes functionality via a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for integration with external agents like VS Code extensions and AI assistants. Testing is a core practice, with an emphasis on Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Domain-Driven Testing. The project aims to standardize error handling, data validation, code style, and testing practices across all layers.

## TDD Workflow

### Phase 1: Test Generation (Red Phase)
1. **Analyze ADR**: Deconstruct each ADR into testable requirements
2. **Create Mock Tests**: Implement test files with proper mocking
3. **Define Assertions**: Ensure tests verify expected behavior
4. **Run Tests**: Confirm all tests fail (red phase)

### Phase 2: Production Implementation (Green Phase)
1. **Implement Minimal Code**: Write just enough code to pass tests
2. **Run Tests Again**: Verify tests now pass (green phase)
3. **Check Coverage**: Ensure all ADR requirements are tested
4. **Integration Testing**: Verify ADR interactions work correctly

### Phase 3: Refactoring (Refactor Phase)
1. **Improve Code Quality**: Refactor while keeping tests green
2. **Update Documentation**: Keep ADRs and tests in sync
3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize without breaking tests

## ADR System Integration

The todo.md serves as the glue connecting all ADRs by:
- **Mapping Dependencies**: Shows how ADRs relate to each other
- **System-wide Coverage**: Ensures no gaps in test coverage
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors both test and implementation completion
- **Working Environment**: Defines the expected system outcome
