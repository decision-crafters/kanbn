# ADR 006: Implement Data Validation Layer

**Status**: Proposed

**Date**: 2025-07-03

**Context**:
The application currently lacks a centralized data validation strategy. Validation logic is scattered across different parts of the codebase, leading to duplication, inconsistency, and potential security vulnerabilities from un-sanitized input. This was highlighted as a risk in the ecosystem analysis.

**Decision**:
We will introduce a formal data validation layer at the application boundary using a dedicated library like Zod.

1.  **Schema-Based Validation**: All incoming data from external sources (e.g., CLI arguments, MCP server request bodies) must be parsed and validated against a predefined schema.
2.  **Centralized Schemas**: Validation schemas will be co-located with the features they validate but managed in a central way to ensure consistency.
3.  **Strict Validation**: If validation fails, the request will be rejected immediately with a clear error message indicating the validation failure. The un-validated data will not be passed to the application services.

**Consequences**:

*   **Positive**:
    *   Creates a single source of truth for data structures and validation rules.
    *   Improves data integrity and application security by preventing invalid data from entering the system.
    *   Enhances developer experience by providing clear, declarative schemas.
    *   Reduces boilerplate validation code within business logic.

*   **Negative**:
    *   Requires an initial effort to define schemas for all input types.
    *   Adds a new dependency (e.g., Zod) to the project.
    *   Existing code must be refactored to use the new validation layer.
