# ADR 005: Standardize Error Handling

**Status**: Proposed

**Date**: 2025-07-03

**Context**:
The project currently has inconsistent error handling mechanisms. Some functions throw generic `Error` objects, others use custom error classes, and some fail silently without clear feedback. This makes debugging difficult and the application's behavior unpredictable, as noted in the recent ecosystem analysis.

**Decision**:
We will implement a standardized error handling strategy using custom error classes that extend a base `AppError` class.

1.  **Custom Error Classes**: Create specific error classes for each layer (e.g., `DomainError`, `ApplicationError`, `InfrastructureError`, `PresentationError`). These classes will include properties for status codes and context.
2.  **Layered Error Propagation**: Errors originating in a lower layer (e.g., Infrastructure) must be caught and re-thrown as an error type corresponding to the catching layer (e.g., Application). This prevents infrastructure-specific details from leaking into the domain or presentation layers.
3.  **Centralized Handling**: All public-facing API endpoints (CLI and MCP server) will have a centralized error handling mechanism to catch all unhandled exceptions, log them, and return a consistently formatted error response to the user.

**Consequences**:

*   **Positive**:
    *   Creates a predictable and consistent error handling flow.
    *   Improves debuggability by providing clear, traceable error paths.
    *   Enhances application reliability and user experience by providing meaningful error messages.
    *   Decouples error handling logic from business logic.

*   **Negative**:
    *   Requires an initial effort to refactor existing code to use the new error classes and patterns.
    *   Adds a small amount of boilerplate for custom error definitions.
