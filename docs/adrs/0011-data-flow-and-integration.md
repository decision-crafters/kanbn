# 11. Data Flow and Integration Testing

**Status**: Accepted (Reconstructed)

**Context**:
The Kanbn application relies on a clear data flow between its layers: from the CLI controllers, through the core domain logic, to infrastructure services like file I/O and AI integration. It is critical to have tests that verify these pathways to prevent regressions and ensure system reliability.

**Decision**:
We will implement a focused strategy for testing data flow and integration points:

1.  **Test Core Operations**: We will create end-to-end or high-level integration tests for the most critical operations:
    *   The full lifecycle of a `Task` (creation, update, movement, archival, deletion).
    *   Core `Board` operations (column and swimlane manipulation).
    *   File I/O, ensuring tasks and boards are correctly read from and written to the filesystem.
    *   AI service integration, including successful calls and fallback/error handling.

2.  **Focus on Integration Points**: Testing efforts will be concentrated on the boundaries between layers (e.g., Controller-Service, Service-Repository) to catch errors where they are most likely to occur.

3.  **Comprehensive Error Handling Tests**: We will explicitly test for failure scenarios and ensure that the application handles errors gracefully (e.g., providing clear user feedback, returning correct exit codes).

**Consequences**:
*   **Pros**:
    *   Increased confidence in the stability of core application features.
    *   Early detection of regressions in critical pathways.
    *   Improved reliability of the overall system.
*   **Cons**:
    *   Integration tests can be slower and more complex to write and maintain than unit tests.
