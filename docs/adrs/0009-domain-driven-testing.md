# 9. Domain-Driven Testing Strategy

**Status**: Accepted (Reconstructed)

**Context**:
The project is adopting a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach. To ensure the testing strategy aligns with this architecture, we need a clear set of principles for how to test domain logic, use cases, and aggregates. A consistent approach will improve test clarity, maintainability, and ensure that our tests accurately reflect the business domain.

**Decision**:
We will adopt a domain-driven testing strategy with the following key practices:

1.  **Use Case-Based Integration Tests**: All integration tests that cover specific application use cases will be located in a dedicated `test/integration/usecases/` directory. This separates them from lower-level component integration tests.
2.  **Aggregate-Focused Tests**: We will create domain-specific tests for our core aggregates, including `Task`, `Board`, and `Sprint`. These tests will validate the business rules and invariants enforced by the aggregates.
3.  **Ubiquitous Language**: Test descriptions (`describe` and `test` blocks) will use the Ubiquitous Language of the domain to make their purpose clear and understandable to all team members.
4.  **Co-location of Unit Tests**: Where feasible, unit tests for specific domain objects (entities, value objects) will be co-located with the source code file (e.g., `Task.js` and `Task.test.js` in the same directory) to improve discoverability.

**Consequences**:
*   **Pros**:
    *   Tests will be more expressive and easier to understand.
    *   Clear separation between unit, integration, and use case tests.
    *   Tighter alignment between the codebase and the testing suite.
*   **Cons**:
    *   May require some adjustments to the existing test structure.
    *   Co-location might clutter source directories if not managed carefully.
