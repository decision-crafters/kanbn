# 10. Code Style and Test Structure Standardization

**Status**: Accepted (Reconstructed)

**Context**:
As the codebase grows and more developers contribute, maintaining a consistent code style and structure is crucial for readability and maintainability. This is especially important for the test suite, where clarity and predictability are paramount. We need to formalize our standards to avoid divergence.

**Decision**:
We will enforce the following code style and structure standards, particularly for test files:

1.  **ESLint Enforcement**: The project's ESLint rules (based on `airbnb-base`) will be strictly applied to all test files (`.test.js`).
2.  **Standardized Test File Organization**: All test files will follow a consistent structure:
    *   **Imports**: Mocked dependencies and test utilities should be imported at the top, clearly separated from actual module imports.
    *   **Test Structure**: Use nested `describe` blocks to group related tests by feature or context. `test` (or `it`) blocks should have clear, descriptive names.
    *   **Naming Conventions**: Follow consistent naming conventions for variables, mocks, and test descriptions.
3.  **Adherence to Jest Best Practices**: All tests will follow established Jest best practices, including the proper use of setup (`beforeEach`) and teardown (`afterEach`) hooks, matchers, and mocking capabilities.

**Consequences**:
*   **Pros**:
    *   Improved code quality and consistency across the project.
    *   Easier onboarding for new developers.
    *   Reduced cognitive load when reading and writing tests.
*   **Cons**:
    *   Requires an initial effort to bring all existing files into compliance.
