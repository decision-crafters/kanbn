# ADR 002: AI Feature Strategy

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-07-03

**Context**:
This document outlines the strategy for integrating AI-powered features into Kanbn to enhance task management, project initialization, and user interaction. It formalizes the existing AI capabilities into an architectural decision.

**Decision**:
The AI feature strategy is defined as follows:

## AI Service Integration
Kanbn will support multiple AI service providers to ensure flexibility and resilience.

1.  **OpenRouter Integration**: Serves as the primary AI service provider, accessed via an API key (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`).
2.  **Ollama Support**: Provides local AI model support for enhanced privacy and offline capability, configured via `OLLAMA_HOST`.

## Enhanced Project Memory System
An enhanced project memory system will be implemented to provide persistent context and enable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities for more context-aware AI interactions.

## AI-Powered Features

1.  **AI-Powered Initialization** (`kanbn init --ai`):
    - The AI will analyze the project description to suggest board columns, create initial tasks, and set up task relationships.

2.  **Project Management Chat** (`kanbn chat`):
    - An intelligent chat assistant that maintains conversation context, understands project state, and leverages RAG for informed responses.

3.  **Epic Management**:
    - AI will assist in creating and decomposing high-level epics into smaller, actionable tasks, maintaining parent-child relationships.

4.  **AI Task Decomposition** (`kanbn decompose --task <task-id>`):
    - The AI will analyze task descriptions to identify logical subtasks and suggest priorities and dependencies.

## AI Interaction Tracking
All AI interactions will be logged to maintain a history of suggestions, changes, and decisions, ensuring transparency and reviewability.

## Parent-Child Task Relationships
Tasks will support parent-child relationships to manage dependencies, track progress accurately, and improve project organization.

## AI-Friendly Task Prompts
Kanbn will provide a feature (`kanbn prompt --task <task-id>`) to generate formatted prompts for external AI tools, ensuring consistency and context.

## Error Handling and Recovery
Robust error handling will be implemented for AI features, including graceful fallbacks between services, automatic retries, and state preservation during failures.

**Consequences**:
- Establishes a clear architectural foundation for all AI-powered features.
- Ensures a consistent and integrated user experience for AI interactions.
- Provides a flexible framework for incorporating new AI services and capabilities in the future.
