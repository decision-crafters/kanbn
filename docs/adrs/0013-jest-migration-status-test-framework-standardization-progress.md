# Jest Migration Status: Test Framework Standardization Progress

## Context and Problem Statement
The Kanbn project is transitioning from QUnit to Jest as the standard testing framework. This migration is approximately 70% complete with several key components already migrated. The transition involves fixing integration test failures, ensuring proper test isolation, and aligning with Jest best practices. The migration has revealed several architectural issues in the test suite, particularly around test isolation, verification methods, and environment setup.

## Decision Drivers
* Improve test isolation and reliability
* Align with current JavaScript testing best practices
* Address architectural issues revealed during migration

## Considered Options
* Continue with QUnit and address issues
* Migrate to Jest following established patterns
* Explore alternative testing frameworks

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: "Migrate to Jest following established patterns", because it addresses the identified issues, aligns with best practices, and leverages the existing migration progress.

### Positive Consequences
* Improved test isolation
* Better error messages
* More reliable test results
* Alignment with current JavaScript testing best practices

### Negative Consequences 
* Temporary testing gaps during migration
* Potential regressions if tests are not properly converted
* Requires updating documentation, training developers on Jest patterns, and ensuring CI/CD pipeline compatibility

## Migration Status (2025-07-03)
Current progress: 70% complete

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Implemented consistent task name uniqueness helper (createUniqueTaskName function)
- ✅ Fixed Parent-Child Relationships test failures (using getTask() instead of taskExists())
- ✅ Fixed Sprint Assignment test failures (using unique sprint names)
- ✅ Fixed Epic Workflow Operations index initialization

### Remaining Tasks
- ❌ Fix Epic deletion cascade behavior test
- ❌ Run all tests and verify fixes
- ❌ Document migration patterns for future tests

## Implementation Details

### Established Patterns
1. **Test Isolation**: Use unique identifiers (with timestamps) for all test resources to prevent conflicts between tests
2. **Proper Verification**: Use getTask() to retrieve and verify objects rather than taskExists()
3. **Environment Setup**: Initialize Kanbn with required columns before running tests
4. **Consistent Naming**: Follow Jest naming conventions for describe/test blocks
