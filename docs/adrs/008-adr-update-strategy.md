# ADR 008 - ADR Update Strategy

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2025-05-07

## Context

Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) are valuable for documenting key decisions and their rationale. However, their value diminishes if they become outdated. We need a strategy to ensure ADRs reflect the current state of the Kanbn project and are consistently maintained.

## Decision

We will adopt the following strategies to encourage and remind the team to keep ADRs updated:

1.  **Link ADRs in Code/Documentation:**
    *   Where relevant, code comments (especially in module headers or complex logic sections) should reference the ADR(s) that influenced their design.
    *   Broader design documents or README sections discussing architecture should link to the relevant ADRs.

2.  **Pull Request (PR) Template Check:**
    *   The project's PR template will include a checklist item: "Have you considered if this change requires a new ADR or an update to an existing ADR? If so, link it here: ____".
    *   Reviewers should be mindful of this and ask for ADRs if significant architectural changes are introduced without corresponding documentation.

3.  **ADR Review as Part of Feature Development:**
    *   For significant new features or refactoring efforts, reviewing existing ADRs and considering the need for new ones should be part of the initial design and planning phase.
    *   If a planned change contradicts an existing ADR, the ADR must be updated (e.g., status changed to "Superseded by ADR-XXX") or a new ADR created to document the change in direction.

4.  **Periodic ADR Review (Optional, Team-Dependent):**
    *   The team may decide to hold brief, periodic (e.g., quarterly) reviews of existing ADRs to ensure they are still relevant and accurate.
    *   This is particularly useful for ADRs with "Proposed" status to ensure they are moved to "Accepted" or another appropriate status.

5.  **"Living Document" Mindset:**
    *   ADRs should be treated as living documents. It's acceptable to revise them (while preserving history or superseding them clearly) as understanding evolves or requirements change.
    *   Use statuses like "Accepted", "Deprecated", "Superseded by ADR-XXX" to show the lifecycle of a decision.

6.  **Documentation Hub:**
    *   The `README.md` will serve as a central pointer to the `docs/adrs/` directory and highlight the importance of ADRs (as already implemented).

## Consequences

**Positive:**
-   Increased likelihood that ADRs remain relevant and useful over time.
-   Better onboarding for new team members as they can trust the documented decisions.
-   Clearer understanding of architectural evolution and the rationale behind changes.
-   Promotes a culture of documenting important decisions.

**Negative:**
-   Adds a small amount of overhead to the development process (e.g., updating PR templates, discussions during code reviews).
-   Requires discipline from the team to follow the strategy.
-   If not managed well, could lead to "documentation for documentation's sake" if the ADRs created are not impactful decisions.
